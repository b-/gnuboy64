1.Extract "toolchain.tar.lzma"
2.Read the extracted README file
3.Do the installation (to a -separate- sdk path if you have a n64 sdk previously installed *This is important*)
4.Now you're ready to compile the code :
export N64_INST=/path/to/sdk
make -f Makefile.driver_name (ie : make -f Makefile.myth64)
(Currently only neomyth is supported.If you would like to add support 
for your flashcart have a look at /filesystem/ &/filesystem/drivers/ and just replace the missing bits )
