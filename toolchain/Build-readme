General build instructions:
1.Extract "toolchain.tar.lzma"
2.Read the extracted README file
3.Do the installation (to a -separate- sdk path if you have a n64 sdk previously installed *This is important*)
4.Now you're ready to compile the code :
export N64_INST=/path/to/sdk
make -f Makefile.driver_name (ie : make -f Makefile.myth64)
(Currently only neomyth is supported.If you would like to add support 
for your flashcart have a look at /filesystem/ &/filesystem/drivers/ and just replace the missing bits )

FS Driver specific build instructions:
*Myth64 SD driver requires libff to be installed on the target SDK path , so make sure to install libff from 
/filesystem/drivers/fs_lib/libff/ (export N64_INST=/path/to/sdk\make && make install) before attempting to compile the emu core.
*ED64 drivers are not yet implemented
*64DRIVE drivers are not yet implemented
